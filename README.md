# Tic Tac Toe Inception
This game might look very simple and ordinary, but can provide a lot of fun and will make you think. It's regular tic tac toe with a twist.

The board is divided into nine sub-boards of three by three. The first move, you can put your colour in any square you want. Where that square is in it's containing sub-board will decide in what sub-board your opponent will have to play his next move. If the first move is put in a bottom left square of a sub-board, your opponent has to put his move somewhere in the bottom left sub-board. If you get three in a row in a sub-board, you win that sub-board. The goal of the game is to win three sub-boards in a row. If your opponent forces you to play in a square that is already won, you are free to play wherevery you want. Don't worry if this sounds complicated, any field that gets coloured when you go over it is a possible move to play.

Have fun!
